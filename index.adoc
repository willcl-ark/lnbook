The current license does **not permit derivative or commercial work**. This means, it does **not** permit independent translations without pemission/license from O'Reilly Media (publisher).

It is expected that the book will be released under a more permissive CC-BY-SA license within a year of publication (i.e. Jan 2023). At that time we will provide a Transifex project for volunteer translations and it will be allowed to produce and share PDF or other ebook versions of the book.
